<h1>German is NOT an SVO language</h1>
<p>omg, this is from GitHub!</p>
 
<p>Linguists classify English as a &ldquo;SVO&rdquo; Language</p>
 
<p>&ldquo;SVO&rdquo; describes the <strong>structure of a standard affirmative English sentence: Subject - Verb - Object.</strong></p>
 
<p>Example:</p>
 
<p style="margin-left:40px">The dog (subject) eats (verb) the apple (object).</p>
 
<p><strong>German</strong> may also<strong> look like a SVO-language</strong>, if we read a sentence like&nbsp;</p>
 
<p style="margin-left:40px">&ldquo;Der Hund isst den Apfel&rdquo; = The dog eats the apple.</p>
 
<p>but this is a very specific case and therefore misleading.</p>
 
<p><br />
Let&rsquo;s give a look to other German sentences:</p>
 
<p style="margin-left:40px">&ldquo;Heute hat der Hund den Apfel gegessen&rdquo; = Today the dog has eaten the apple<br />
[Today - has - the dog - the apple - eaten] <em>&lt;= these translations in brackets respect the German sentence order</em></p>
 
<p style="margin-left:40px">&ldquo;Den Apfel hat heute der Hund gegessen&rdquo; = Today the dog has eaten the apple<br />
[the apple - has - today - the dog - eaten]</p>
 
<p><br />
These sentences are correct and their structure is very common. Do you notice how their structure does <strong>not correspond to SVO</strong> anymore?</p>
 
<p><strong>First thing</strong>: the verb &ldquo;eaten&rdquo; is at the end.</p>
 
<p><strong>Second thing</strong>: in the first sentence, the verb &ldquo;has&rdquo; is before the subject.</p>
 
<p><strong>Third thing</strong>: in the second sentence, the object (&ldquo;apple&rdquo;) comes before the verb, while the subject (the dog) comes later.</p>
 
<p>We have to conclude then, that German sentence structure is different from English, even though sometimes it looks identical.<br />
